        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Very Open minded human being with a pleasant personality who’s passionate about all sciences and tech is seeking for an innovative career change. Having experienced different jobs and studied many different topics, I decided to educate myself, to be able to work in a field that I enjoy and to build up a good life in the coming years. That’s why I chose to follow the web developer path, to which I can also successfully integrate my communication and analytical skills from my        previous experiences.</p>

            <p>I started studying psychology, where I learned a lot about human and animal behaviour, until I found myself reading more books about physics and making music than studying the science for which I actually was at university.</p>

            <h4>Accountant</h4>
            <p>Currently working as an accountant in a bus and travel agency, where I’m learning to pay attention to details and stimulating my analytical thinking. Something that’s often neglected in such jobs is the ability to communicate properly with colleagues, a skill that I definitely have.</p>

            <h4>Counter agent</h4>
            <p>Helping more than 100 customers a day in different offices leaves one with a strong ability to communicate with foreign people and staying comfortable towards the client. Another skill acquired during this year was the capability to fulfill the clients requirements and solve his problems in the shortest amount of time.</p>
